# Corporate Device Management API

A RESTful backend for managing corporate mobile assets — clients, employees, devices, and SIM lines — built as a portfolio project to practise **Hexagonal Architecture** and **Domain-Driven Design** with Java and Spring Boot.

## Live Demo

> **Both services are hosted on Render's free tier and may take up to 50 seconds to respond on the first request after a period of inactivity.**
>
> **To use the app, open both links and wait for each service to finish waking up before interacting with the frontend.**

## Architecture

The project follows **Hexagonal Architecture** (Ports & Adapters), keeping domain logic completely isolated from frameworks and infrastructure.

```
src/main/java/com/tfg/digitalcitizen/platform/
│
├── client_service/
│   ├── core/               # Domain model + port interfaces
│   ├── application/        # Use cases, DTOs, mappers
│   └── infrastructure/     # REST controllers, JPA repositories
│
├── device_service/         # same structure
├── line_service/           # same structure
├── user_service/           # same structure
├── report_service/         # same structure + external Feign adapters
│
└── shared/                 # Cross-cutting: exceptions, value objects, config
```

**Dependency rule:** `infrastructure` → `application` → `core`. Nothing in `core` depends on Spring or JPA.

- PostgreSQL 15+

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cfval/corporate-device-management-api.git
cd corporate-device-management-api
```

### 2. Set up the database

Create a PostgreSQL database named `digital_citizen`:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE digital_citizen;
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

The application reads configuration from environment variables. Defaults are provided for local development:

| Variable | Default | Description |

| `DB_USER` | `postgres` | Database username |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | `admin` | Database password |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` | `http://localhost:5173` | Configurable allowed CORS origin |
| `CLIENT_SERVICE_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | Internal client service base URL |
| `DEVICE_SERVICE_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | Internal device service base URL |
| `LINE_SERVICE_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | Internal line service base URL |
| `USER_SERVICE_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | Internal user service base URL |

### 4. Build and run

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.
Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`
